## Implementation approach:
To implement the math operation calculator, we will use the following approach:
1. Create a simple command-line interface for the calculator.
2. Use the built-in Python math library for performing basic arithmetic operations.
3. Implement additional functions for advanced operations such as square root and exponentiation.
4. Use a loop to continuously accept user input and perform calculations until the user chooses to exit.
5. Display the calculation results clearly on the console.

For the user interface, we will use the `click` library, which provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface for Python applications. This will allow us to easily handle user input and display the results.

## Python package name:
```python
"math_calculator"
```

## File list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "calculator.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Calculator{
        +add(a: float, b: float) -> float
        +subtract(a: float, b: float) -> float
        +multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float
        +divide(a: float, b: float) -> float
        +square_root(a: float) -> float
        +exponentiate(a: float, b: float) -> float
    }
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Main
    participant Calculator

    User->>Main: Run the calculator
    Main->>User: Display welcome message and options
    User->>Main: Choose an operation
    Main->>User: Prompt for input numbers
    User->>Main: Enter the numbers
    Main->>Calculator: Perform the selected operation
    Calculator->>Main: Return the result
    Main->>User: Display the result
    User->>Main: Choose to continue or exit
    Main->>User: Repeat the process or exit
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
The requirements are clear and there are no unclear points.
